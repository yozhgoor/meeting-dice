A CLI tool that helps you to choose in a team who's gonna be the next meeting chair.

## Installation

`cargo install meeting-dice`

## Usage

## List the members of the team

```
meeting-dice --list
```

This will print:

* The members of the team.
* Member(s) that will not participate to the meeting.
* An eventual last meeting chair.

## Specify who was the last meeting chair

```
meeting-dice --last-chair <name>
```

This command will return an error if the `name` doesn't exists in the members list.

## Add member(s) to the team

```
meeting-dice --add-members <names>
```

If a name already exists in the members list, it will not be added.
Note that this is checked on lowercase values so `John == john`.

## Remove member(s) of the team.

```
meeting-dice --remove-members <names>
```

## Select a meeting chair

Since all the options that we mentioned before can be used without actually choosing a new meeting
chair, you need to pass `--run` to randomly select the new meeting chair.

```
meeting-dice --run
```

If you want to list the members before the run, you can use:

```
meeting-dice --list --run
```

After printing the selection, the program will ask if you confirm the selection and store it for the
next run.

### Remove temporarily member(s) of the team

If a member of the team can't be present for this meeting, you can remove him from this run like
this:

```
meeting-dice --hide-members <names> --run
```
